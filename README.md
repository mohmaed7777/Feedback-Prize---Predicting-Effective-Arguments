# Feedback-Prize---Predicting-Effective-Arguments
Rate the effectiveness of argumentative writing elements from students in grades 6-12

# Summary of the competition task:
The goal of this competition is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," or "ineffective."
You will create a model trained on data that is representative of the 6th-12th grade population in the United States in order to minimize bias.

Models derived from this competition will help pave the way for students to receive enhanced feedback on their argumentative writing.

# Data Context:=
The dataset presented here contains argumentative essays written by U.S students in grades 6-12. These essays were annotated by expert raters for discourse elements commonly found in argumentative writing:

Lead - an introduction that begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or some other device to grab the readerâ€™s attention and point toward the thesis

Position - an opinion or conclusion on the main question.

Claim - a claim that supports the position.

Counterclaim - a claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position.

Rebuttal - a claim that refutes a counterclaim.

Evidence - ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, or rebuttals.

Concluding Statement - a concluding statement that restates the claims

# The  task is to predict the quality rating of each discourse element. Human readers rated each rhetorical or argumentative element, in order of increasing quality, as one of:
Ineffective

Adequate

Effective
